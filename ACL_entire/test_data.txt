There is no point in coming down here 
What are you so excited about This isnt a moon landing were talking about Its fish Its fish nobody even eats 
Its PR Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach

Yes 
So lets go home 
I just dont Its stupid 
This what What is this This isnt even anything 
Oh right sure This is standing on the beach This is waiting This is fighting 
You must admit that he was in love with you wasnt he 
What of it 
What 
Adders dont snap they sting 
Mind your own business 
Youre quite insufferable I expected its because youre drunk 
On the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy 
Oh shut up

Turn it on again please 
Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic 
Turn it off 
Let go of me Youre a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you Thank God I discovered in time what youre really like 
Youre a mean evil minded 
little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live 
Never never never Id rather die in torment Beast brute 
Isnt there anything you can do Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line 
You got called up 
Right but part of the agreement is that Im paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me 
No I dont think I am I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me and I brought it you know from Africa Its not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want 
Are you crazy 
All right But dont think like that because I mean what the hell did we do all this for Chris The whole business its all for you The whole shooting match is for you 
I want you to pretend like hes coming back 
I cant help it 
You must admit that he was in love with you wasnt he 
You let him kiss you You said you did 
You neednt be so grand simply because you dont happen to want any at the moment 
Really Amanda 
You must have a riotous time no restraint at all very enjoyable I mean you never had much anyway 
Turn it off 
I hate you 
Yeah very amusing Let me go Im getting out of here I cant believe I intended to marry you 
Let me know thats thats fine You think I have an abrasive vibe whatever Youre entitled to your opinion of course Maybe thats why I dont have a job

Ill get out Ill go get married and live someplace else I dont know maybe New York 
All right But dont think like that Because what the hell did we work for Chris I mean this whole thing its all for you 
Ive given it three years of thought I had hoped if I waited dad wouldve forgotten him by now and we could have a a regular wedding and everybody happy 
Are you crazy 
What have I got to hide Kate What the hell is the matter with you 
Twice is every time weve tried thats ever 
Well thats a nice point of view I must say 
Amanda really 
They snap 
You better turn that off I think 
Well there are people downstairs I suppose 
Very well If you have to be boorish and idiotic 
You are far too temperamental Try to control yourself 
Stop Would you just go away I mean youre conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible

No You know what you get You know what you get You get this 
I know me neither 
I know but she needs to be safe more She needs to be around kids her ageown age She needs to be able to play on the streets and 
I dont want you in danger And I dont want her in danger 
I just dont want him to be gone 
I mean he was like really conscious right up until the end you know 
Nobodys ever gonna forget him 
He did a lot But 
You start to lose like that image after a while 
I can see that 
Youve gotta tell me 
Well I lost them 
Just about all 
I got this idea watching them go down Everything was being destroyed see but it seemed that there was one new thing being made A sort of responsibility Man for man 
And while we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them 
Im going to miss you too I dont know what Im going to do here without you Its going to be so lonely and so hard 
Ive never been Ive never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year 
I dont know its just not I dont know I dont know what to do really you know Im just thinking 
Kathy died last night 
yeah I mean you know it was a 
She really cared about you you know 
so loving everybody you know 
We were all going take a trip to Europe you know 
Then shes gone 
Its going to be okay I promise 
Its just going to take a while I think 
Yes 
If I cant do that here well then Ill have to get out 
Well I lost them 
Just about all 
To show that to bring that onto the Earth again like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him 
Otherwise all you have is really loot and theres blood on it And I didnt want to take any of that And I guess that included you 
And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them 
No 
Well but this isnt anything like I thought anything would be like 
No I know But still I know I dont make you happy 
Youre the one who probably wishes he was with someone else someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didnt take everything so hard 
Augie Im sorry 
No that desire will fade along with our passion 
And Uh Yeah Uh Theyre going to need um more nurses on call for uh to go overseas to help out with the war 
Honey Im going to come back Its not like that 
But it it is for a year 
What do you mean 
I dont know if I if I could take it 
I cant be that strong A whole year 
me oh my god 
I will come back 
It doesnt look very good 
And And then Ill stop working and Ill stay home with the baby 
Its all I ever knew how to do I cant quit now 
How are we supposed to tell Amy Hows she supposed to understand that 
Dont do that to me 
Im sorry babe 
All right then 
Okay 
Yeah Wow 
so wrong in so many ways 
So talented 
Some people 
Yeah God I loved that kid 
Joe do you think he knew I loved him 
I dont know 
I dont know if Benny was smart like that but 
Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer My whole entire life time and time after time 
Shes faithful as a rock dont you know In my worst moments I can think of her 
No youve got to believe 
Well youve been embarrassed ever since I came 
Lets drive somewhere I want to be alone with you 
No What is it Is it your mother 
Yeah sure 
Well I lost them 
It takes a little while to toss that off Because they werent just men 
For instance one time it had to have been raining several days There was this one kid he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks Put them in my pocket 
Everything was being destroyed see but there was one new thing that was being created A kind of responsibility man for man You understand me 
And I went to work with dad and that rat race again And I felt what you saidashamed somehow Because nobody was changed at all It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys 
And I didnt want to take any of it 
And I guess that included you 
Do you remember the last time we came here 
they need me out there sooner than I thought 
No 
Do this whole thing by myself 
yeah 
No 
It just feels like I was talking to him yesterday 
What happened What went wrong 
Oh man 
I mean I havent even talked to him on the phone for the past three months 
Why is that 
Working for corporate America Wow 
I dont know But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen 
But from her letters I think shes forgotten him Ill find out 
No you dont Im a pretty tough guy 
Look 
you saw the way that she acted and then well I mean you you were acting kind of 
How many 
Takes a little while to toss that off cause they werent just men 
For instance one time thisit had been raining several days and this one kid he came up to me he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket 
It was a kind of responsibility man for man You understand me 
And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him 
And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said ashamed Somehow because nobody was changed at all 
Otherwise what you have is loot and theres blood on it 
Rather not hope for something 
This is just this You know I mean its a lot and everything but it isnt somewhere else Do you know what Im trying to say 
I didnt say that 
If anybody wants to be with anybody else its probably you Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard 
You want me tell you that Im okay with it 
I just I just thought he would have longer you know because Im I mean when he found out he was sick we knew that wasnt good but I just I just thought that it would take longer you know 
Yeah I know 
I wanted to get this settled first 
No 
I know you are Augie Really I do I know you wanted this to be special and nice and its the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldnt help thinking about being somewhere else 
No I know but still I know I dont make you happy 
somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didnt take everything so hard 
I know I know theres nothing I can say that will really help but 
a major part of your life and then theyre gone And I dont know Thats not really its never really happened to me before 
But Im here if theres anything you need I mean you just have to ask I know 
Hows um hows his parents doing 
I mean what do you want to do Do you want to do you want to talk about it Do you 
Yeah I dont know Sometimes I wish I didnt know him So I wouldnt 
I mean its just not fair Like I dont know Why people 
I dont know what to do 
I hope it rains Somehow thatll make me feel more comfortable 
I cant help it 
Yes I suppose there has been But its going from me 
It takes a little time to toss that off because they werent just men 
There was no meaning in it here The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again I felt what you said ashamed somehow 
um 
I dont know sigh 
I dont think theres anything we can do 
Its not fair 
I know I know its not fair 
I understand Im worried about you I dont know whats going to happen to you 
I dont know 
I know 
sigh Three weeks 
Its hard to watch when its painful for them you know 
Absolutely absolutely 
I just I dont know 
Yeah And they were really supportive like through the whole process but 
Of course not You have no idea what its like to lose a kid 
Thank you 
Its really bizarre you know when you know somebody really well and then 
something happens and they die and its like 
BREATHING 
Whats he going to say Maybe we should tell him before he sees it 
Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came 
Yeah I lost them 
just about all 
Oh gee 
I know that thats not a big thing but its just the kind of guys I had They didnt die They They killed themselves for each other 
I rather not remember some things I rather not hope for some things 
No I know me either 
Sweetheart Ive got to tell you something I just got a call Im going to Iraq

They wont let you come along Its not going to happen 
But Im supposed to be okay with you going there 
Well I guess were at a stalemate then arent we 
Yeah I tried that And there was like yeah like I did like one thing once But like thats not it doesnt last very long And its not enough to live on 
But like its been years now and I just cant seem to get anything that really fits Its just it I it drives me absolutely insane 
Thats cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing And I thought this time it was I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing So its your fault because 
And he told me to come to this desk here so I can uh at least get uh the hundred hundred and fifty dollars that that Im owed for my loss 
Cause thats roughly how much the bag plus all its contents was worth 
We really we want to work with you We really we want to help

The fifty dollars Im going to give you for your bag is really all Im concerned with 
Im more than happy to not argue about it I will give you your fifty dollar certificate 
Thank you for calling Sprint We care about everybody How can I help you 
Yes and Ive been through all of the menus pushed one and star and pound and all of that stuff and Im just trying to get through to a person who can

No just making myself fascinating for you 
I dont want to be rude here maam but line two B is where you need to be This is the line for registration 
I dont have those 
Maam obviously I have no idea how long its taking There seems to be a bit of a line there It looks like thirty forty people It could take four to five hours Im sorry 
Theres nothing I can do for you maam 
But obviously I dont have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things 
No Im not Im sorryIm not stupid 
I dont know who told you that but they were wrong Im sorry 
Do you have a manager I could speak with

I understand but you know what youve been negative for three years 
I just I 
I dont know 
Yeah and I look nice and Im you know 
yah tototally and Im not

Right and also if youll read the fine print of your agreement youll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage it is a fifty dollar voucher 
Well you know what it could still turn up but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher 
And you have no guarantee 
I have no guarantee absolutely not 
Yeah Ill take your fifty dollar voucher 
Well okay well First off fine fine fine Lets see first off um yeah my bills wrong

You better turn that off I think 
Whats the difference Whats the difference between that form and this form 
I dont know I dont know who told you It wasnt me 
There is nothing I can do about it You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line 
ShhI know youve got the power to do that 
Im not leaving this line until I get my new ID Thats as simple as it is Im not leaving this line until I get my new ID 
Theyd put me in jail and then how long when will I get to see the kids What ten years I dont know 
But I mean I dont want to keep those jobs I dont want those jobsIts not what I want to do 
But they always go with somebody else 
Yeah but Im okay well how about personality wise I mean people who know me wont hire me Why 
Do you have any idea how I can make money I mean what can I do to make some quick money something Anything thats relatively within the you know law 
Right probably not selling pot I dont want to go to jail

Why shouldnt he dream about him walk the nights waiting for him Do we contradict him Do we say outright that we dont have any hope anymore That we havent had any hope for a long time 
For Gods sake three years Nobody comes back after three years Its insane 
You know its not just my business 
Ill find out and then well thrash it out with dad all right Mom dont avoid me

Okay 
all right okay And you lost your bag Is that that the issue 
I dont see any record of it and Iusually when I dont see a record of it that means um

Is there anything I can get you Do you want me to take care of anything for you or 
How long were you there for 
You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery
