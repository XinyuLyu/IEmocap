Yes 
Last year youll also remember we gotour shoes got wet I got sand in my panties you got a sore throat we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions 
Why do you ask me that God damn it I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that Its insulting 
Because they never do Do they have they ever 
No we wont Its pointless its like a waiting up to see Santa Claus 
I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show 
You think nothing turns out how its supposed to You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line We would come to this beach and argue over fish No

Whatll I do with a fortune 
What time is it Theyre supposed to run around midnight 
I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid wed miss it

How you doing Aw you know what I forgot I forgot to bring my flashlight Oh how could I be so stupid I shouldve brought my flashlight 
This is great isnt it A six pack would be just the ticket right now 
You think they can hear us talk Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around 
Think about the people in Kansas they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this We live forty minutes away Its too good to pass up 
Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives All that flopping is laying eggs or what do youspawning or mating I mean

Alright But its fish that do something that none of the other fish do Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs 
There is thatno thats just seaweed isnt it 
Oh man this is great isnt it I wouldnt miss this for anything Here think about this all right I know youre not interested but think about this 
Its like single mindedness with no mind Its urgency thats pure urge They dont know what drives them They dont ask it a question or give it a name 
They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death 
Ah God Im giving myself goose bumps Look all my hairs are popped up

Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way

This is the big night for these guys Lifes last orgy 
Ah man this is great I wouldnt miss this for anything I mean think about this I know youre not interested but just think about this for a minute 
Out there someplace theres this huge mass of silver fish heading this way They dont know why We dont know why It wasnt a decision They didnt take a vote

Ah Im giving myself goose bumps All my hairs are popping up 
Thats it right You want this to be like the other time right Thats it

Look there whats that Is it Is that aAh its a seaweed isnt it

Im sorry Joy 
No 
You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out 
I went to see her headstone a week or two ago 
I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died I just you know I felt like they were urban oasis you know there is always this green in the city 
So I was like wandering around before It takes forever to find her headstone I always lose it You know 
So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone And 
Yeah And she was like thats pathetic I hope you enjoy it 
I dont know It just like I felt so bad because I shouldnt have done it I dont know Whatever 
Yeah 
At the cemetery 
Its weird Whenever I go back to town I think of her I mean its like I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one And yeah She had cancer she had two brain tumors 
She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day 
Umm Yeah 
And the last time before she died I remember she couldnt really stand umm 
Some I guess She memorized this one John Dunn its called Death Be Not Proud and 
Hey lets drive some place Huh Lets get out of here 
No its nothing like that Its 
Yeah I suppose I have been But its going from me 
I dont even know how to start 
Its just all mixed up with so many other things you know You know overseas I was in command of a company 
Well I lost them 
Pretty much all 
Aw geez 
You cant just toss off a thing like that because they werent just men You know 
They didnt die they killed themselves for each other I mean that exactly Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today 
To bring that on to the earth again you know is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them 
But then I came home and it was incredible you know The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident You know I went back to the rat race again I went to work 
And I didnt want any of it I guess that included you 
Im cold 
I feel like Im always just standing here waiting I feel like this night is going to be the night but it never is 
Id rather not remember some things Id rather not hope for some things 
I know you are Augie I know 
I know you meant this to be special I know that you wanted it to be right but I just cant help thinking that I cant help wishing that I was somewhere else 
Maybe if you were with someone else too 
I didnt say that 
I just I know I dont make you happy 
Youre the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else Somebody who doesnt take things so seriously who could enjoy herself 
I have to go back

First thing tomorrow morning 
The National Guard is I guess really spread thin and then everyone has to go We all have to go back my whole companies going back

So weird 
like I cantits like you know its like pinch me its like I cant believe like Im dealing with this you know 
I dont know But he went back in the kitchen and he cried 
Did you talk to him 
No I figured Id just let it wait 
Cried hard 
Yeah I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room 
BREATHING 
I guess he is 
No I wanted to get this all sorted out first 
Then help me stay here mom 
Then help me stay 
No you dont Im a pretty tough guy 
BREATHING And then youve been kind of 
Youve been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here 
Chris whats the matter 
Do you want to go somewhere Lets go 
No what is it Is your mother 
No no its nothing like that 
I dont know itsits complicated But its going from me now 
You got to tell me 
I dont know 
Its kind of all mixed up with all these other things 
Wouldnt work like this 
you know over seas I was in command of the company 
Well I lost them 
How many 
Pretty much all 
BREATHING Geez 
Takes awhile to toss something like that off I mean they werent just men you know 
He just put it in my pocket thats the kind of guys I had 
You know that they were bringing something on to this earth a kind of sacrifice you know 
I thought I would change everything you know and I got back here and it was it was like nothing had changed at all 
You know I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again 
And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them 
Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator 
Cause you can take those things out of a war But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man 
And if you cant see that then its just loot and theres blood all over it 
I felt ashamed and I didnt want any part of it I guess I included you too 
Do you still feel that way 
I want you to know Annie 
And I remember thinking this is it finally finally Im as happy as Im supposed to be 
Id rather not remember some things Id rather not hope for some things 
No 
No 
No no Im just like you I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and 
This isnt anything like I thought anything would be 
This is just this I mean it includes a lot and everything but itsdo you understand what Im saying 
Im doing the best I can 
I know that Augie I really do 
I just cant help wishing that I was somebody somewhere else 
Maybe if you were with somebody else too 
I didnt say that 
No I know butI know I dont make you happy 
Yeah 
You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else someone who didnt take everything so seriously someone who would enjoy yourself 
Augie Im sorry 
Darling dont say that 
Its almost time for me to go 
Theres nothing I can do I mean the government you know 
Youre gonna have to I mean youre a great father You can do it I know you can 
I dont think so 
Well we can do the best we can andand with um you know like wireless internet these daysI think that we could Talk every once in awhile 
You could send me pictures 
Their not gonna let you You have to stay home and I have to go I mean thats all 
andI mean my daughterI dont want to put her in danger You know She has to stay 
But shesyoure not gonnayoure not gonna be here forfor her first words For her first steps I meanits something that youre supposed to be here for that 
You can just remember it for me 
Well I needI need you to be able to do this for me cause I cant do anything about it 
I mean its just as hard for me butI know that we can do it you know 
I have no choice Theres nothing I can do 
All right 
I feel so worthless 
I just wanna crawl in a hole you know Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning 
Um Johnny died yesterday 
We knew that it was coming but 
It seemed like he had a little bit longer Like just last week he was doing was so well 
Yeah 
And his whole family was there 
He was so young you know And all the stories he used to tell me about 
the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to Africa and he was gonna 
Im gonna forget him 
I wont be able to hear his voice or his 
Thanks 
Did you talk to him 
He cried hard 
What was he doing out here at that hour 
Ive got an idea but whats the story 
Well if she does then thats the end of it But from her letters I think shes forgotten him Ill find out And then well thrash it out with Dad right Mom dont avoid me 
Trouble is you dont see enough women 
from her point of view why else would I come 
No Nothing like that 
Then whats wrong I mean even in your letters there was somesomething ashamed 
Yeah I suppose I have been But its going from me 
I dont know how to start 
It wouldnt work this way 
Its all mixed up with so many other things You remember overseas I was in command of a company 
Yeah sure 
How many 
Oh gee 
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off Cause they werent just men 
They didnt die they killed themselves for each other I mean that exactly A little more selfish and theyd have been here today 
You know what I mean To show that to bring that onto the Earth again like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him 
Then I came back and it was incredible There was no meaning in it here The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident I went to work with Dad and that rat race again 
I mean you can take those things out of a war but when you drive that car youve gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man Youve gotta be a little better because of it 
Because otherwise all you have is really loot and theres blood on it And I didnt want to take any of it And I guess that included you 
You still feel that way 
Do you remember the first time we came to see it It was about four years ago right after we got married 
I thought I was pregnant you had a bottle of champagne but no glasses You asked me to dance so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork 
And I remember thinking this is it You know at lastat last I am as happy as I am supposed to be 
Just dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne out of the bottle 
Id rather not remember some things I would rather not hope for some things 
No 
No 
No 
Well This isnt anything like I thought anything would be like 
I know me neither 
Im doing the best I can 
I know that Augie Really I do 
I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all but I just couldnt help thinking about being somewhere else 
Maybe if you were with somebody else too 
I didnt say that 
No I know But still I know I dont make you happy 
Youre the one who probably wishes you were with someone else Someone whoyoud rather enjoy yourself and didnt take everything so hard 
Augie Im sorry 
I dont want you to go 
I know I know I dont want to go either baby I love you know And Im going to miss you a lot 
I dont want to be a single mom 
You wont be Ill be back Ill be back before you know it All right and

You gotta take care of our baby for me alright 
Ill send you lots of pictures 
I hope so because Im not going to be able to survive without all that I dont know what Im going to do 
Well just promise me that you going to be safe

It doesnt make any easier yes 
I mean at least she was home she wasnt in the hospital anymore 
Oh man Im so sorry 
She was with yeah She was with Gary and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep closed her eyes and that was it 
Its going to be so rough Im sorry 
Yes I mean its not as rough on me as it is on him but

Yeah 
out to out to dinner you know and do the troops to California I mean 
Totally 
Its just that I dont know its sort its sort of a weird thing you know 
Yeah 
not being able to see anyone again who knows where they really went you know I mean I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if its anywhere that its better I mean 
Yes Well at least you have a lot of good memories 
She was garbage 
Yes I mean she cared about all of us She was great 
And she was 
Gosh I just hate I just hate to see her go 
Yeah 
Even if you still do shell shell be there 
Yes BREATHING God 
Are you going to be okay 
I just I just dont get it like there is just nothing you can do about it you know its like just out of your control and it 
just makes it that much harder to deal cause as much as you want to you know make her better see her not in any pain its like just I dont know just has a mind of its own 
Well you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me I mean it definitely helps 
Sure 
to talk to somebody but 
you shouldnt be alone 
Yes

I could hear him right through the floor in my room 
I dont know Ill find out Then well trash it out with dad right Mom dont avoid me 
Ill get out Ill get married and go live some place else maybe New York 
Yes on this I would

No Nothing like that 
Well whats wrong I mean even in your letters there was somesomething ashamed 
Yeah I suppose I have been But its going from me 
It wouldnt work this way 
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off Cause they werent just men 
They didnt die they killed themselves for each other I mean that exactly I mean a little more selfish and theyd have been here today 
I got this idea watching em go down Everything was being destroyed see but it seemed that one new thing was made A sort of responsibility Man for man You know what I mean 
Then I came back and it was incredible There was no meaning in it here I mean the whole thing to them seemed like its sort of a bus accident I went to work with Dad and that rat race again 
Do you still feel that way 
Cause you mustnt feel that way Because you have a right to everything you have Chris Everything you understand that Me too 
I mean and your money theres theres nothing wrong with your money I mean your father put hundreds of planes in the air A man should be paid for that 
Im just not 
Do you remember the first time we came to see it It was about four years ago right after we got married 
We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses you asked me to dance we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork 
and I remember thinking that this is it you know At last at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be 
Just dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne out of the bottle 
Id rather not remember some things I would rather not hope for some things 
No

I know 
I didnt expect this to happen I never planned for this Some things you just dont plan for you know 
Im so sorry 
I just I see all these other people getting commercials and work and its like Im not getting anything 
its not funny I just dont know what Im going to do 
Yeah I guess I could 
Yeah 
Mmm hmm I never knew it was going to be this hard you know 
Its weird cause its like you expected it to happen and eventually 
he had cancer you know 
They thought he gotwould get better and he did and then it just things turned bad 
Turned around for the worst you know 
I didnt know him Tricia but uh I heard that he was a great man 
He was amazing 
I loved that boy 
We did everything together you know 
Its weird I think I feel so alone you know What am I going to do now Now that hes gone 
Hes so young It seems so 
His poor parents You know its their only son 
Kind of a whole year I mean he suffered with this this monster this thing this disease 
He was in chemo the whole time right 
And he just got that baseball scholarship 
I know He was he had so much going for him 
So handsome so young so gifted 
Such a sweet person you know 
Hows his parents doing 
Not very good 
Can you imagine though you know as a parent just losing a kid Twentytwo years old 
Its weird I kind of feel like part of me is gone now you know 
Because this other half was just kind of like ripped away 
You guys were pretty close werent you 
He was like he was like my brother you know 
He was my brother 
Just seems so unfair is the way it is 
You know he had that really pretty girlfriend for like about a year and 
What was her name 
Kelly Kelly Uveny 
They talked about getting married and 
Trying to have a baby 
Yeah But then when he got cancer and it got bad you know she just took off and 
so I was there for him 
Yeah but you were there all the hospital days By his bed 
So nice so positive 
yeah 
We need more people like him 
I never told him I love you but 
I loved him so much 
Im sure he loved you too He just didnt know it 
You got to keep believing 
I cant help it 
No Im not sorry Its 
Well then tell me whats wrong I mean even in your letters theres something ashamed 
Yeah I guess there is I guess I was but uh its going from me now 
You should tell me 
I dont know where to start 
But Chris it wouldnt work like this 
You know when I went overseas I said I was in command of a company 
How many 
Just about all 
Geez 
And I and I thought something watching them go down 
And to show thatto bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him 
And I came back here and it was incredible There was no meaning in that here The whole thing to them was a bus accident 
Otherwise what you have here is loot and theres blood on it 
And you still feel that way 
Because you cant feel that way never again Chris You hear me Never I mean the money and me too 
Fine 
Not particularly 
I dont know I just dont 
We thought I was pregnant 
You brought a bottle of champagne 
I told myself finally this is how happy Im supposed to be 
I dont want to remember something 
Hope for some things 
No 
No 
No no 
Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be 
its not something else Do you know what Im trying to say 
I know you are Augie and I know you wanted this evening to be nice but I cant help thinking of being somewhere else 
I didnt say that 
Im sorry Augie 
Oh dear well shall we want that

I dont know what to do 
You know I cant say no 
and watch our child grow see her take her first steps her first words 
Honey after a year I can be back 
You said two years 
They want me there two years but I could probably get

A whole year Were not talking about like a couple months here I mean this is a whole year 
I know I know But they really need some good guys there 
What could happen in a year 
And this isnt the first time you know I mean you alwayssending you off to different places and 
Well thats the kind of work Im in honey

Hows it going How are you feeling 
I ah 
alright 
Hanging in there 
Yeah 
So sad 
Yeah 
You guys were real close huh 
He was my only friend growing up 
no one else would talk to me but he would 
He was supposed to be the best man at my wedding 
Im so sorry 
Yeah 
You know I was always the one to tell him to be more wild you know 
And he just took it overboard 
You know a stupid case of drunk driving its just 
and the worst part of it is that he was in the car with his girlfriend 
his girlfriend got killed too 
And the car that he hit was his family 
How are they 
The mother and father died 
and the kids are paralyzed in a coma right now 
and just going to the funeral its 
do I miss him or do I hate him you know 
Yeah Like I mean if you need anyone to talk to or anything Im here for you okay 
Were all here for you 
I was supposed to see him last summer 
then I got busy with work and stuff and three years go by 
and then something like this happens you know 
Hes supposed to be my best friend 
I know 
just things happen in life and you justtheres just no explanation you know We just dont 
Its so fucked up 
Yeah 
Im so sorry 
He was studying to be a doctor 
I mean he washe wanted to help people in poor countries that is his goal He didnt care about the money He just wanted to go and help people 
What thewhat am I doing 
He actually wanted to do something 
Well now you can follow his footsteps you know Carry out what he wanted to do 
I cant do that 
Well sure you could 
You shouldve met him 
He is the greatesteveryone liked him 
Yeah 
I wouldve loved to 
Now I cant 
He saw it 
He was out there when it happened 
About four in the morning I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened 
Did you talk to him 
No I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone 
He cried hard 
I could hear it right through the floor 
I guess he is 
Hes getting just like he did after he died you know What what whats the meaning of this 
I dont know But I know one thing mom we made a terrible mistake with dad 
Ive given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy 
Tell me something You can leave this business 
I know Just you help me stay here 
I am thinking like that 
I dont understand you do I 
Yeah I can see that 
My worst times I think about her you know and I 
its like I know as long as shes waiting Im right again 
Look it was just last week that Detroit some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry you can read it for yourself You above all people have got to believe 
I cant help it 
No Im not sorry But Im not going to stay 
Well I dont know embarrassed of her since I came 
Nothing Hey lets drive somewhere I want to be alone with you 
You remember overseas I was in command of a company 
Well I lost them 
Just about all 
Geez 
Thats just a little thing but thats the kind of guys I had They didnt just die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly 
A little more selfish and theyd still be here today And I got this idea watching them go down See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created 
And then I came here and it was incredible There was no meaning in it here The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident 
It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys I felt wrong to be alive I felt wrong to have that new checkbook 
open that new bank account drive the new car and see the new refrigerator 
And I didnt want to take any of it and I guess that included you 
And you still feel that way 
We thought I was pregnant 
Id rather not remember something 
No 
I know you are Augie I know you wanted this evening to be nice 
I cant help thinking about being somewhere else 
Maybe if you were with someone else too 
I know But I know I dont make you happy 
Augie whatever Im doing Id rather be doing with you 
Well I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people 
Thats serious enough 
So youre leaving tomorrow 
Yeah They just called 
This is reallythis is unfair 
I know 
I dont know what to say I dont want to go but I dont have a lot of choice 
And uh Im afraid that if you you know when you leave you wont come back 
Im going to come back I need you to believe that 
Well you have to have faith because I dont have a choice and I have to go 
Do you think I want to leave you 
I have to do this I dont want to leave Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up 
And now and now its really shitty timing but now I have to go 
Whats that supposed to mean 
I mean we cantwere not a complete family without you here 
I dont know how else to leave it What do you want me to lie to you 
I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be I mean its not a great situation but we dont have an option here 
Well I cant be okay with it the same way you cant not go It just doesnt work that way 
Fine 
Hey Im uh Im really sorry about what happened I dont um I mean what you can you do I mean its 
Thanks 
You know its just I just you know I mean it just happened I just like I just keep expecting him to walk in you know 
Mmhmm Yeah Yeah I mean its its hard Its hard 
Yeah 
Yeah I know I know 
you know its inevitable and I mean honestly its its almost like 
Yeah I know But Id rather have him here with me you know Its just not fair I mean he he didnt get to do like anything I mean he was 
Yeah 
It just doesnt seem fair 
Its not fair but I mean thats you know the course of life is that you know you meet people and you lose them 
Youre okay 
Thank you for being here 
You know I think I think we should celebrate because I think thats what he would have wanted 
Thats right Thats right I mean he would want us to you know celebrate the life that he that he lived and you know enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can 
So 
Did you talk to him 
No I figured the best thing was to leave him alone 
I could hear him right through the floor of my room 
These years when I think of someone for my wife I think of Annie What do you want a diagram 
No nothing like that 
Yes I suppose I have been but its going from me 
Theres so many things mixed up 
You remember overseas I was in command of a company 
Well I lost them 
How many 
Just about all 
It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they werent just men 
For instance one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks 
I put them in my pocket thats only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had 
They didnt die They killed themselves for each other I mean that exactly A little more selfish and theyd have been here today 
And I got this idea watching them go down Everything was being destroyed see but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made 
a sort of responsibility man for man You understand me 
And then I came home and it was amazing 
I felt what you said ashamed somehow 
because nobody was changed at all It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys 
I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book to drive the new car to see the new refrigerator 
when you drive the new car you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man Youve got to be a little better because of that 
Otherwise what you have is really just loot and theres blood on it I didnt want to take any of it 
I guess that included you 
We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses You asked me to dance So we took off our shoes 
and you popped the cork and while we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me 
right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as so that I could feel them as much as hear them 
And I remember thinking this is it At last at last Im as happy as Im supposed to be 
Dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne from the bottle 
I would rather not remember some things I would rather not hope for some things 
Maybe if you were with somebody else too 
Its only going to be a year 
You wont even know your child when you come back This isnt there someone you could talk to 
When do you leave 
Hey how you doing 
Im sorry 
Thanks 
I know I just I dont know Its just weird because you have somebody whos you know 
Im sorry Its never easy 
Yeah 
Thanks 
it doesnt really do anything But 
I just its just not fair 
I know It never is 
I mean theyre you know theyre upset Its like you know they 
feel the same way everybody else does 
BREATHING I mean theres nothing really to talk about Hes gone and Ill never see him again 
Well I know its not a lot of help or anything but at least you got to know him I mean at least you had the time with him that you did 
Yeah 
I mean we can be grateful for that 
You feel that way now because youre upset But you dont really think that 
This is just this is a terrible life I just dont understand 
there should just be some sort of rule that people dont die until theyre older cause then at least its expected 
I agree If I knew how to make that happen I would certainly help you 
Whens the service Can can we help Is there anything I mean 
I mean you you can go I dont know I dont know what else 
Seems like if the whole worlds sad then its okay for you to be 
Yeah 
I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically 
I know 
Just you know some thing some genie I need to find a genie bottle 
I dont have any magic answers But 
I mean as as cliche as it is as long as people who loved him remember him then its not a waste you know 
I know 
Hes getting just like after he died Whats the meaning in that 
father forgot about Larry wed have a regular wedding and everything happy If I cant get that here then Ill have to get out 
I dont know where to start 
Its all mixed up with so many other things You remember overseas I was in command of a company 
Well I lost them 
How many 
Just about all 
Oh gees 
And I got this idea watching them go down everything was being destroyed see But to me it seemed there was one new thing that was made 
a kind of responsibility Man for man You understand me And then I went home and it was incredible 
because nobody was changed It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys I felt wrong to be alive 
You have to be a little better because of that Otherwise we have is really loot and theres blood on it I dont want to take any of it I guess that included you 
Dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne from the bottle 
Id rather not remember some things Id rather not hope for some things 
No 
No 
I didnt say that 
No I know But still I know I dont make you happy 
No That fire will fade along with our passion

metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasnt looking good but 
Thats the worst Im so sorry Did you know him well 
Yeah We were Pretty close 
BREATHING 
I am so sorry Its 
Its the worst when they go like that GARBAGE Was he young 
Kind of 
Its the think 
Theres no reason for it 
I know 
And he could of He was pretty awesome 
Yeah Whatd he do What did they do Howd you know him 
Uh We grew up together 
yeah 
Yeah he kind of did a lot of things but we acted together sometimes 
I feel really bad for his family you know 
Yes of course of course 
It must be really really hard to lose a child 
BREATHING 
I cant imagine what his what his parents are going through 
Yeah Im just going to miss him 
Yeah theyre going to do some sort of memorial service or something 
Thanks 
really hard to imagine that like youre going to continue to live and that persons just going to have stopped 
Right it just doesnt make any sense its not real It doesnt feel real 
yeah 
Its hard to say goodbye 
BREATHING 
yeah yeah 
He saw it 
He was out here when it broke 
Around Four this morning and there was a crack and I looked out Were standing right there when I cracked 
I dont know but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen 
Did you talk to him 
No I figured it was best to leave him alone 
He cried hard 
I could hear him right through the floor of my room 
He is thinking about him again 
Its getting just like after Larry died hes having dreams hes walking around at night 
I guess he is 
Whats the meaning of that 
I dont know the meaning of it But I know one thing mom did We made a terrible mistake with dad 
Being dishonest with him Its the kind of thing that pays off and now its paying off 
You know that Larrys not coming back and I know it So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him 
You know why I asked Annie here dont you 
You marry his girl and youre pronouncing him dead Now whats going to happen to your father do you know I dont 
Youve got to believe Youve got to 
Yeah I suppose I have been But its going from me 
It wouldnt work like this 
Its Its mixed up with so many other things I 
Remember when I was overseas I was in command of the company 
how many 
Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they werent just men 
for instance theres this one time It had been raining for several days And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks you know He just put them in my pocket 
I mean that exactly thata little more selfish and they would have still been here today 
And I got an ideal watching them all go down Everything was being destroyed see and 
but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time a kind of responsibility man for man Do you understand me 
And to show thattoto bring that back onto the earth again like a like a monument And everyone would have it standing behind them and and it would make a difference for them 
And then I went home and it was incredible It had no meaning here 
It was all like some kind of bus accident to them I went back to work with my dad in that whole rat race again 
And I felt what you said ashamed somehowbecause nobody had changed at all It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys and 
Augie do you remember the first time we came to see it It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant 
Dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne from the bottle 
No 
No 
This what What is this This isnt even anything 
Sure this is standing This is waiting This is fighting 
But this isnt anything like I thought it would be 
I mean it is just this I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know its the sand and its the full moon and I justI am sorry but I couldnt help wishing I was somewhere else 
Maybe if you are with somebody else too 
I didnt say that 
No I know but I know I dont make you happy 
For heavens sake Augie wherever I am I always wanted to be with you 
Whatever I am doing I wanted to be with you I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else somebody who didnt take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself 
I know its really crappy timing but I dont have a choice 
I dont have a choice I have to go If I dont go theyll come and take me 
I dont want to the kids Youve got to take care of them Youve got youve got to 
I dont have I know What are we gonna What are we just run away What can I do Where can we go 
I know But IllIll send the pictures all the time and Ill write them emails and you can read them the emails that I send them

I just want to be honest with you I dont want you to 
but its gonna be fine Im gonna be fine You know Im good at this I can do this Thats why I trained all this time Im good at this Okay

I just got some bad news 
My friend Shotty passed away 
Oh Im so sorry 
Oh my gosh 
Yeah Its just I never thought it would actually happen you know I mean Hes such a fighter and hes always so positive about everything 
he wanted to travel you know And hes so talented Probably the most talented person I have ever met in my entire life 
What did he do 
He was a designer you know But he did everything You know He painted and he and he did costume design he did set design he did lighting he was 
Yeah Im so sorry 
I mean one second you think you know youre just having a conversation and then 
You guys have been 
You think that things get easier you know as you as you get older and you 
and it just gets worse It just gets worse everything is bad all the time people die your friends die family dies your best friends die its 
You always think you know when you were you know when you were a little kid and you think something is gonna happen like it will all be better when I am older you know 
Wow Ryan I know that you are hurting right now but I dont think you always feel like that 
No youre right I dont Youre right 
Even yeah he doesnt he would never feel that way he would never want me to feel that way Of course not but thats just where I am right now and I dont know what else to do with it 
Yeah I understand I think its really healthy to grieve 
I just miss him 
Thanks 
Whats he going to say Maybe we should tell him before he sees it 
When I was the first one up He was still in bed How could he have seen it 
No I figured it was best to leave him alone 
Whats he going to say Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it 
He was out here when it broke 
About four this morning I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked 
I dont know But after he saw it he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen 
No I figured it was best to leave him alone 
Yes yes he is I dont know the meaning in it But I know one thing mom we made a terrible mistake with Dad 
Like Larrys brother Do it like you Chris Whats the matter 
Lets go for a ride I I I want to be alone with you 
Even in your letters there was something ashamed 
You have to tell me 
It wouldnt work like this 
How many 
Just about all 
It It takes time to toss something like that offI mean because they werent just men 
I mean that exactly anymore selfish just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down 
It was and then I went home And it was incredible It didnt have any meaning there 
I felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all 
And I guess that included you 
Do you still feel like that 
I want you now Annie 
Because you cant feel like that anymore Chris Because everything you have you have a right to me included 
Im just not 
I did want to see it I always want to see it I just I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is 
And I remember thinking to myself finally I am as happy as I am supposed to be 
Dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne out of the bottle 
I would rather not remember some things Id rather not hope for something 
No

But I just couldnt help thinking about being somewhere else 
I didnt say that 
No I know But I know I dont make you happy 
For heavens sake Augie whatever I am doing Id rather it be with you

Nash 
Yes 
What do you want to do Argue with him 
I dont want to argue but its time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive 
You know Why shouldnt he walk the nights thinking of him dreaming of him Do we contradict him Do we say we dont have any hope anymore That we havent had any hope for years now 
You cant say that to him 
Wheres the proof Do you have any proof 
For Gods sake three years Nobody comes back after three years thats insane 
All right all right all right You know why I asked Annie here right 
Why 
Then its not just my business 
From your fathers point of view he is not dead and Chris he still thinks hes still alive The girl is Larrys girl 
Now you can go on from there if you know where to go but Im telling you I dont know where to go 
To hell with that 
I just dont see why Have you asked Annie yet 
Well how do you know shes going to marry you Maybe she feels the same way your father does 
The trouble is you dont see enough women You never did 
So what Im not fast with women 
Why does it have to be Annie 
Because it is 
Oh thats a great reason Its no reason at all 
I dont know 
I cant help it I know her best I was brought up next door to her you know These years when I think of someone for my wife I think of Annie 
Mom what do you want A diagram

Last year you will also remember our shoes got wet I got sand in my panties you got a sore throat we got in a big fight over nothing and we didnt see the grunions 
Its ridiculous

For heaven sake were not going to see the grunions 
Why not 
We never do do we I mean have we ever 
Twice is every time weve tried Thats ever 
No we wont Its pointless Its like waiting up to see Santa Claus 
I thought you wanted to see it 
You dont understand anything Im saying 
All right Look Ive been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst 
Well what You want me to breathe in your ear 
You wanna get married again 
No 
What What You want a divorce 
No 
A vacation 
No 
A new carpet A poodle Ice cream Back rub A suicide pact What What Carla what the hell do you want

You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on 
No it isnt 
Yes it is 
Doesnt seem to have worked such wonders with you 
Nonsense They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap 
They snap 
I dont care do you understand I dont care I dont care if they bark or roll about like hoops 
Mind your own business 
I expect its because youre drunk 
As I mentioned before I have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long A child of two couldnt get drunk on that 
On the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy 
Oh very interesting How about a child of four A child of six Or a child of nine 
Not very funny dear Youd better have some more brandy 
Because its late and itll annoy the people upstairs 
There arent any people upstairs Its a photographers studio 
This is no time of the year for Tunis 
Very amusing indeed 
All right Finally Here you go 
Okay so what are you saying What 
Well Im sorry sir but 
you need to bring two forms of ID there is nothing we can do about it 
Well its actually 
Its standard that you bring a couple of forms of ID Im sorry 
Well Im sorry sir but were not responsible 
Yes you did thank you very much but were not responsible if youve forgotten something and we need to have two forms of ID 
Okay What about no how about you hold that and Ill Ill go and I can come back 
Im sorry but there is a lot of people waiting so youre just going to have to get in line again 
It just happens to people all the time Im sorry sir but I cant make an exception for you 
This is ridiculous Come on 
I cannot go back in that line Ive got stuff I need to do I mean 
That doesnt make any sense Why 
Im sorry sir There is nothing I can do 
Well if you had checked the web site it would have said 
Well maybe you should 
Right So maybe you should go home now and get your paperwork and come back 
God oh my 
This is ridiculous 
Im sorry sir its not my choice 
Its Its dangerous anywhere honey I mean this is this Im just going to go and well get it over with 
It doesnt make any sense I dont know why we have to be at war in the first place 
Uhm I dont know 
I dont know what Im going to do about this I mean 
I have got to get a job you know Like 
Well yea you know I get my resumes and I mean I 
I go out all the places I can every place thatll give an interview you know 
I dont know I mean why why 
Yea it says Im stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else 
I mean maybe Im not you know I dont have a job Maybe maybe Im not as good asas I thought I was and 
I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and 
maybe maybe take up painting I dont know you know 
Do something that I dont have to go out and do something stay at home I dont know 
Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment 
I know but I mean if thats the you know Im either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesnt 
I mean I dont know I dont see I dont see any other way any other way around it right now 
I really I really need that bag 
I mean Ive been away for a while and and now Ive Ive gifts for for you know friends and family I mean I got stuff in the there 
can they check there 
see where it came from originally I mean it seems like 
This is unbelievable Ive got 
so if its back there or something if there is something you can do 
I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag okay 
Youve already checked Can you check again garbage 
Ive already looked thank you very much and because weve filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar 
Uh huh yea lost some of my possessions yes so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carryon 
that might be like fifty dollars okay but this I garbage I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase 
because this is ridiculous 
I dont believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh in which we can reimburse you and thats all we can do and Im sorry Ive done everything I can 
All right Im sick Im sick of this all right Im sick of you and keep your fifty dollar 
like press nine press zero press back to the menu like I cant get through to what Im supposed to get through to 
Okay Oh that would just make it so much better cause I cannot handle its just like oh my God I cant sit here any longer and talk to this lady with this pleasant voice 
it really freaks me out when I got my bill because it was like I dont I didnt spend this This is not my charge 
and it was like something like eight hundred dollars I dont remember It was just a lot and I have thing in front of me right now but 
Cause II just dont know how someone could have gotten my charge information 
You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him 
What do you want to do argue with him 
No I dont want to argue with him but its about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore 
You cant say that to him 
Can you prove it how can you prove it 
To you it is and to me You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you 
All right All right Listen to me 
No its not only my business 
What do you want me to do youre old enough to know your own mind 
So its all right then Ill go ahead with it 
Im just saying 
Shes not Larrys girl 
You can go on from there if you know where to go but I dont know where to go see I dont know So what can I do for you 
Have you asked Annie yet 
Because it is 
Thats a good answer but it doesnt answer anything I mean you havent seen her since you went away to war its five years 
I dont want a diagram He thinks hes coming back Chris you marry this girl youre pronouncing him dead 
Do you know whats going to happen to your father because I dont see 
Then help me stay here 
I know I know mom All right Just help me stay here 
Just dont go thinking that way 
Well I am thinking that way 
I dont understand you do I 
What do you mean He lived next door to the girl all his life why wouldnt he want to see her again 
Then why is she still single I mean New York is full of men why isnt she married Probably a hundred people told her shes crazy but shes waited 
How do you know why she has waited 
She knows what I know thats why Shes faithful as a rock In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that Im right 
Look its a nice day what are we arguing for 
Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe Strangers might but not his father not his brother 
But Kate 
Because if hes not coming back Ill kill myself And laugh laugh at me but 
Calm yourself 
Calm yourself

That Im sorry 
Hi Ive been on the phone for an hour trying to get a little discrepancy on my bill fixed I was charged for two hundred dollars worth of calls that I didnt make 
Im positive They came from like another state

Uh Yeah I just gave it to the automated thing like five times 
Im going to need it again I need to look at your file If you want me to look at your file 
Okay three two three six nine seven five zero six six Can we move on 
Well Im looking at these 
So can you please refund the mischarged charges 
I did not make the calls from BFE Nebraska

of the money that I was charged that I didnt make those calls 
Okay no look I I I Im really Im trying to be patient I know this isnt your fault I know that you didnt do it 
but at the same time I have been through an hour of little robot voices telling me what I needed to do 
Excuse me 
How long does that take 
I dont know the meaning of it mom But I know one thing we made a terrible mistake with dad 
What do you mean dishonest 
What do you want to do Argue with him 
I dont want to argue with him but its time he realized that nobody believes Larrys alive anymore 
You know why 
Now you can go on from there if you know where to go But Im telling you I dont know where to go See I dont know 
Now what can I do for you 
I dont know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back because other people will suffer My whole bloody life time after time after time 
To hell with that 
Because it is 
Line 
Ive given it three years of thought Id hope that if 
Ive been a good son too long a good sucker Im through with it 
I know that Just you help me stay here 
No you dont Im a pretty tough guy 
What do you mean He grew up next door to the girl all his life Why shouldnt he want to why shouldnt he want to see her again 
Look its a nice day What are we arguing for 
What do you want me to do What do you want 
But Kate 
Calm yourself 
Calm yourself 
Alright alright Calm yourself 
Why me above all 
Well sure 
Thats my point 
No no no Thats not my point My point is is that theres no point in coming down here if we just leave Dont you want to see it 
Not particularly 
Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives I mean all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating something like that 
This isnt a moon landing were talking about Its fish Its fish nobody even eats 
We didnt see them the first time either 
Thats the wind 
About what 
Carla can I ask you something Dont take this the wrong way but are you having your period 
Twice is every time weve tried Thats ever 
Well see them this year 
You dont have any idea what Im saying 
No of course not 
Its just fish nothing to get traumatized over 
Ive been trying to work this backwards but I cant seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse 
Uhokay So Im putting on my jacket putting out the animals 
uh taking the car out of the gara out of the garage 
Uh 
What you want me to breathe in your ear 
No 
You want to get married again 
No 
What you want a divorce 
No 
A vacation 
Yes it is 
Right 
Im doing the best I can 
As a matter of fact the real cause of that row was Peter Burden 
I knew nothing of the sort You took presents from him 
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden 
If you hadnt been so nosey you never would have known a thing about it 
Ill have a little myself I think 
I dont see why you want it Youve already had two glasses 
No particular reason Anyhow they were very small ones 
It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing 
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on 
You neednt be so grand just because you dont happen to want any at the moment 
Oh That reply has broken my heart 
It doesnt seem to have worked such wonders with you 
They sting 
I think I mentioned once before that Ive only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening Thats hardly enough to get a child of two drunk 
Okay Im sorry but I just stood in this line for an hour can I Is there any way I can 
No they told meIm sorry but they told me to be in this line 
What I mean what whats the difference What do I need to do there that I cant do here 
Can you justcan I just get the right 
Simply step to line two A maam Im sorry 
Would you be able to put me at the front of that line 
There is a large line of people behind you waiting to be 
I know Ive been in line with these people I understand I understand what its like Could you please like call over and 
I hear that I hear that Thank you but Ive waited in line for so long and I dont want to have to be here all day 
I dont have those forms maam I cant help you Thats why you need to go to line two A 
And how long is that going to take 
I dont 
I dont have time for this today and 
Is there anything you can do Please have some compassion Is there something you can do 
I am a very compassionate person and Im offended that you imply that Im not Of course Im compassionate Look I work in the DMV What do you think I am Go wait in line two A 
Dont ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself I cant come back over there Ill get security if you need me to 
what no Im sure they did not tell you here 
No they did The lady over there told me to stand in this line and Ive been here for an hour 
what The lady what the janitor 
No 
Im not saying that youre stupid maam I think you just said that you were stupid 
It doesnt work that way here maam 
There is a strict system here You need to wait in the right line for the right thing This is the line for registration 
Except theyre going tell are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least 
I told you it was line two A 
Are you being straight with me 
Im being very straight with you maam There is nothing I can do for you You need to stand in line two A 
Fine 
The kids 
Its going to be at least six months probably a year I tried 
I know I know Its really really messed up 
I dont know I dont know what Im going to do I dont know how to 
I dont know Im justIm trying to think of something 
You cant what 
I dont know Baby why are you asking me this Its just as hard for me Please try to understand that 
I understand baby Im sorry I mean try to understand Im Im scared myself 
I dont know I mean what am I supposed to do Ive Its not for lack of effort Ive been trying 
I wish I had some answers for you babe I meanI dont know what to tell you 
How did you get a job What am I What am I supposed to do 
I 
I mean on six seven and five an hour does not does not pay the bills I mean 
I mean I can do the McDonalds thing for a while as humiliating as that is but I mean then what I mean You cant exactly move up in that kind of industry 
Oh come on thats not what I envisioned for myself Honestly would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds 
This is humiliating 
No I dont I dont want to accept that I think thats bullshit 
I dont know I feel like Ive tried everything 
Three years of going out every dayevery dayand looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go 
Its three years 
But its true babe Youve got to be more positive about things Like Have some faith in yourself 
Brian I dont think you have a concept of what I mean by by money I dont mean money like oh I cant go get my hair and my nails done today I mean like I cant eat 
You can 
Yeah I dont intend to stop trying I justI dont when is when enough is enough 
charismatic 
Yeah I always think so but I I just feel like its a lot of lip service everywhere I go 
Its just like its a matter of 
not tall enough not pretty enough notyou know how this place is 
I mean anything 
Yeah I dont know where it was lost I was coming from Africa so 
Right well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when its going to get here 
Yes sir I know what my bag looks like 
And you couldnt find it 
No it didnt turn up at the baggage claim 
I mean weve gone through all of this Ive been to five people already who 
Well obviously that wasnt me so Im going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point 
Okay 
Yes lots of really like sentimental value only but 
Does this happen often Do theyyou just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it 
Obviously maam 
I am sorry maam 
Thats what the cost of the ticket was for 
Maam international flights are not cheap and theres many reasons for that It does not have solely to do with your baggage or 
Right Yes maam 
Why do I need flight insurance Why dont you guys just guarantee that youre going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination 
Right but if Im riding a bus I dont need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me 
Because they made me check it Its too heavy 
Theres nothing else you can do 
Obviously Im doing everything that I can here 
So Im just supposed to oh well oops my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher 
Well you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up And if it does then well deliver it to you 
This is ridiculous 
How can I guarantee finding your luggage when its lost 
Uh Because you guys lost it so it should be your responsibility to find it too 
Right well when youre at home and you lose something do you guarantee that youre going to find it later on 
Oh come on Would you cut it out This is ridiculous 
Well it sounds to me like youre being ridiculous 
I understand that maam but things get lost Theres nothing I can do about that Things happen Accidents happen 
Thanks 
Oh thank God Do you know how long Ive been on the phone for half an hour trying to talk to a freaking human being 
All I want to do is put my pay for my freaking credit card and theres something wrong in my bill Like I swear it says I didnt paid last month but I know I paid last month 
I put Ive been typing my number in millions of times it wont listen to me its not working and I cant get a single human being and finally 
Sir 
I got it in the mail 
Well when I look online it says it says that I was charged a late fee so Im assuming that I paid on your web site 
Okay 
Because I paid it on time 
No um I dont want to argue with him but its time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive 
We have to say it to him 
To you it is and to me but not to your father Now look you can talk yourself blue in the face but theres no body and theres no grave so where are you 
All right All right mom Listen 
You know 
You know thats not just my business 
So its all right I can go ahead with it then 
I ignore what I got to ignore The girl is Larrys girl 
Now Chris you can go on from there but I dont know what to do I mean do you know what to do because I dont 
I dont know why it is But every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back because other people will suffer My whole bloody life time after time after time 
So what Im not fast with women 
Because it is 
I cant help it I know her best I was brought up next door to here the easiest when I think of somebody for my wife I think of Annie Do you want a diagram 
No I dont want a diagram but Chris your father thinks Larrys coming back 
All right then Mom 
Ill get out Ill get married and live some place else Maybe maybe New York 
Wait a minute Tell me this Do you mean to say that you would leave the business 
Dont you you cant think like that Dont think like that 
How do you know he is even thinking about it 
Well so what 
Now listen Kate just 
Shes Then why is she still single New York is full of men why isnt she married Probably a hundred people told her shes foolish but shes waited 
How do you know why shes waited 
Because she knows what I know shes faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that Im right 
Look Its a nice day Why are we arguing 
Nobody in her this house dares shake her faith Strangers might but not his father and not his brother 
What do you want me to do What do you want 
But Kate

Theyre processed differently 
Thats crap Youre crap I dont buy it 
Sir youre gonna have to go stand in the other line 
Well then youre just gonna look stupid because Im just waiting for an ID and youre gonna make security take me out because I want my ID

Hello Hello What Wrong number 
With the most perfect poise 
Things that ought to matter dreadfully dont matter at all when ones happy Do they 
Oh darling dont say that 
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love 
You mustnt be serious my dear one Thats just what they want 
Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light 
Certainly you must Were figures of fun alright 
Well how long will it last us this ludicrous overbearing love of ours 
Who knows 
Well shall we always want to bicker and fight 
No that desire will fade Along with our passion 
Oh dear shall we like that 
Depends on how well weve played 
So is everyone else in the long run 
You remember that awful scene we had in Venice 
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown 
I didnt hit you very hard 
We were very much younger then 
As a matter of fact the real cause of that row was Peter Burden 
I knew nothing of the sort You took presents from him 
Well if you hadnt been so suspicious and nosey you never would have known a thing about it 
Me too Bored stiff You want some brandy 
Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing 
Well its become a habit with you 
Hi How can I help you 
Sure um 
get my new license 
Um no I got my drivers license though 
I actually need two forms of ID I need either a passport or a birth certificate or social security card Im sorry 
Uh sorry I forgot them I mean Ive got to 
well is the dridrivers license going to work 
I I can take your drivers license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work 
Um that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back 
Im sorry sir 
and itll work out you know go there and do that Yeah Ill be back 
So how you feeling 
Youve been doing a lot of work for it right 
Right so the fact you doing the best that you can is 
you know you shouldnt give yourself a hard time for that its the best you can 
Well but you care about what you do right 
I understand that its so frustrating but I know that youre here because you really want it you know and and uh 
Well I mean youre still here youve tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself 
You are persistence I mean thats important thats 
Thats I mean There are more factors then just whether youre good or not you know what I mean like 
So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time 
You know and the fact you still here and still cooking like its good that youre thinking about it that youre reconsidering 
But like just because youre considering why its been so difficult doesnt mean you should just stop 
Maybe you should take a little break from it but I dont think you should stop 
Hi Um 
Hi can I help you 
It seems that uh mymy bag didnt make it out on the carousel 
Yes yes its gone around like you know twenty times Its been about a half hour 
Okay Well um the f 
Actually Im looking here at the information the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage it looks like a few peoples bags didnt make it through Um so 
Okay So whatwhat do I have to get you know 
Well you can fill out this paperwork um and if for some reason it shows up we can bring it to you but 
Well sometimes its just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just Im reading off of this that 
Uh it didnt make it into the second plane so it looks like there they dont actually know what happened to it 
I I I understand but um 
Okay 
Right 
they they it gets shipped to somewhere else and then its stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that 
Right Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reimreimburse you 
Um so 
We have very tight security but we uh there are times when we just cant uh make sure there arent absolutely no human error you know 
Im sorry there is no guarantee on baggage 
I understand so 
all right Weve already checked back here for your baggage 
and we will continue to look for it and because your paper 
Well its its just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than 
The airline cant afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase and so 
Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we dont want to have false claims or anything like that so we have 
we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it to compensate and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely more than likely 
All right Customer service this is Steve 
I Ill give you a little hint next time if it asks if youre on a rotary phone you know just stay on the line instead of instead of hitting one or two to say if youre like on a touch tone 
I know they dont tell you that kind of thing 
Sorry Okay Um yes 
Thank you very much Um So I have a charge on my credit card that um isnt mine 
Yea All right Well let melet me look it up here for a second Uh so i think 
Okay it was um at the GARBAGE sorry it was at a department store I think it was Macys or something 
Okay Alright yeah I I see it on here 
All right Well you know thats thats what we have all of our protection plans for and everything like that so I mean its 
it itll work out fine 
Yes well get well get rid of it right now I mean just were going to have to have you um submit something you know were going to have to have you mail something in for us okay 
So So you can um find that application You have the Internet you can go to our website 
Yeah Yeah You get the form right now and yeah 
We could mail it to you as well but 
Right You can go online print it out and just fill out the form and um send it to us um you know regarding the grievance and 
and itll get taken off um no problem you know 
Right I mean we might 
Okay 
Uh I mean have you been shopping around on the Internet and stuff I mean that you gave 
I did buy one thing on ebay I dont know that might 
so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want you know you can um we can we can issue another credit card 
its a different number and everything 
Right right 
Okay great 
Yeah totally 
Alright Yes Im sorry for all the inconvenience but well get it taken care of
